    <p class="pstretch">I had visited Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan, and I counted that as Iraq. I was too scared to travel
        to ‘real’ Iraq. But it was time to right that wrong. I wanted to travel to Iraq so much, the true Iraq, as in
        Baghdad, Iraq! So having recently been there, is it safe to travel to Iraq? If you’re sensible, organised things
        properly and don’t go to certain regions, then yes, it is safe to travel to Iraq.

        I had great contacts from my travels, so organising my OneStep4Ward group tour to Iraq was actually pretty easy.
        My fixer helped with our visas, and everything was set up ready for us. We all met in Baghdad airport one
        evening, and then we began our 4 days traveling in Iraq, to both Baghdad and Babylon.
